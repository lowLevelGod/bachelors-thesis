abstract = {With the rise of technology and the continued economic growth evident in modern society, acts of fraud have become much more prevalent in the financial industry, costing institutions and consumers hundreds of billions of dollars annually. Fraudsters are continuously evolving their approaches to exploit the vulnerabilities of the current prevention measures in place, many of whom are targeting the financial sector. These crimes include credit card fraud, healthcare and automobile insurance fraud, money laundering, securities and commodities fraud and insider trading. On their own, fraud prevention systems do not provide adequate security against these criminal acts. As such, the need for fraud detection systems to detect fraudulent acts after they have already been committed and the potential cost savings of doing so is more evident than ever. Anomaly detection techniques have been intensively studied for this purpose by researchers over the last couple of decades, many of which employed statistical, artificial intelligence and machine learning models. Supervised learning algorithms have been the most popular types of models studied in research up until recently. However, supervised learning models are associated with many challenges that have been and can be addressed by semi-supervised and unsupervised learning models proposed in recently published literature. This survey aims to investigate and present a thorough review of the most popular and effective anomaly detection techniques applied to detect financial fraud, with a focus on highlighting the recent advancements in the areas of semi-supervised and unsupervised learning.}

abstract = {Anomaly detection in manufacturing systems has great potential for the prevention of critical quality faults. In recent years, unsupervised deep learning has shown to frequently outperform conventional methods for anomaly detection. However, tuning, deploying and debugging deep learning models is a time-consuming task, limiting their practical applicability in manufacturing systems. We approach this problem by developing a deep learning model that learns interpretable shapes that can be used for anomaly detection in temporal process data. Application of the model to assembly tightening processes in the automotive industry shows a significant improvement in model interpretability and scalability.}

  abstract = 	 {When highly-accurate and/or assumptionfree density estimation is needed, nonparametric methods are often called upon - most notably the popular kernel density estimation (KDE) method. However, the practitioner is instantly faced with the formidable computational cost of KDE for appreciable dataset sizes, which becomes even more prohibitive when many models with different kernel scales (bandwidths) must be evaluated - this is necessary for finding the optimal model, among other reasons. In previous work we presented an algorithm for fast KDE which addresses large dataset sizes and large dimensionalities, but assumes only a single bandwidth. In this paper we present a generalization of that algorithm allowing multiple models with different bandwidths to be computed simultaneously, in substantially less time than either running the singlebandwidth algorithm for each model independently, or running the standard exhaustive method. We show examples of computing the likelihood curve for 100,000 data and 100 models ranging across 3 orders of magnitude in scale, in minutes or seconds.},
